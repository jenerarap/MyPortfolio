    <p>
        Im Jener ARAP, born in November 2006, and raised in Prizren, Kosovo. I have a deep passion for robotics and programming, dedicating myself to advancing in this field and contributing to the progress of my country. I have been involved in robotics since the age of 10 and have always been immensely curious about this domain. You can explore my robotic projects, skills, and work experience as evidence of my dedication. I have exerted considerable effort to progress in this field, attending technology schools, participating in competitions, and engaging in various robotic projects to gain more experience. Additionally, I worked in the textile industry to cover the expenses of attending technology school, purchasing necessary materials, electronic devices, and computers. Currently, starting from February 20, 2024, I will be teaching robotics at the Yunus Emre Institute Prizren center, where I have my workshop. Previously, I conducted a course on 3D design at the Yunus Emre Institute under the "GenÃ§ Komek" program. Stay tuned, as I will soon realize my biggest dream, which will be a first of its kind project in Kosovo. I plan to continue my university life in TÃ¼rkiye in order to receive a higher quality education and reach advanced levels. Keep following me;)</p>

The main idea of the competition was to create a project using the MicroBit microcontroller that benefits the community or improves and addresses its problems. I participated in this competition with my "Plant Breeder" project, which I worked on for 7 months.</li>
<li><span>Hackathon#7 Kosova</span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/share/p/YPVWVosckMnwXt8s/?mibextid=xfxF2i" class="seemore"> - See more</a><br>The competition was divided into four main categories: 1) Health and Human Welfare, 2) Environment and Environmental Protection, 3) Education and Knowledge Sharing, and 4) Facilitating the Lives of Individuals with Special Needs. My team participated in the third category of the competition. The main objective of the competition was to develop software based on the specified categories to address problems and generate innovative solutions. Although we did not win first place in the competition but it was a good experience for us. I would like to mention that this was my first competition participation.</li>

            <p>My first robotics project, "Plant Breeder
                ATC" which I worked on for seven months, and won
                1st place in the "21 st Century Schools" national competition in 2021
                that was organised by British Government in Western Balkans. When I built 
                this project I was 13-14.</p>

                Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard
                dummy text ever since the 1500s, 
                when an unknown printer took a galley of type and
               scrambled it to make a type specimen book.</p>
