    <p>
        Im Jener ARAP, born in 2006 Prizren of Kosovo. I have a deep passion for robotics and programming, dedicating myself to advancing in this field and contributing to the progress of my country. I have been involved in robotics since the age of 11 and have always been immensely curious about this field. You can explore my robotic projects, skills, and work experience as evidence of my dedication. I have exerted considerable effort to progress in this field, attending technology schools, participating in competitions, and engaging in various robotic projects to gain more experience. Currently I'm teaching electronics and robotics software at the Yunus Emre Institute Prizren. Previously, I conducted a course on 3D design at the Yunus Emre Institute under the "GenÃ§ Komek" program. I plan to continue my university life abroad in order to receive a higher quality education and reach advanced levels. Keep following;)</p>

The main idea of the competition was to create a project using the MicroBit microcontroller that benefits the community or improves and addresses its problems. I participated in this competition with my "Plant Breeder" project, which I worked on for 7 months.</li>
<li><span>Hackathon#7 Kosova</span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/share/p/YPVWVosckMnwXt8s/?mibextid=xfxF2i" class="seemore"> - See more</a><br>The competition was divided into four main categories: 1) Health and Human Welfare, 2) Environment and Environmental Protection, 3) Education and Knowledge Sharing, and 4) Facilitating the Lives of Individuals with Special Needs. My team participated in the third category of the competition. The main objective of the competition was to develop software based on the specified categories to address problems and generate innovative solutions. Although we did not win first place in the competition but it was a good experience for us. I would like to mention that this was my first competition participation.</li>

            <h2>Plant Breeder</h2>  
            <p>My first robotics project, "Plant Breeder
                ATC" which I worked on for seven months, and won
                1st place in the "21 st Century Schools" national competition in 2021
                that was organised by British Government in Western Balkans. When I built 
                this project I was 13-14.</p>

            <h2>Hydraulic Excavator</h2>  
            <p>I did this project, named "Hydraulic Excavator" , when I was around 11 years old.
                This hydraulic excavator operates entirely on a hydro-mechanical system and incorporates a total of 6 syringes. </p>
