        <p> My first robotics project, "Plant Breeder
        ATC" which I worked on for seven months, and won
        1 place in the "21 st Century Schools" competition in 2021
        that was organised in Western Balkan.
        "Plant Breeder ATC" is a robotic device that can
        fulfill all the needs of a plantüå± that contains various
        systems for different tasks and enabling the growth
        of a plant in a dark room regardless of the season.
        It ensures the efficient growth of the plant by using
        different sensors, algorithms, and automatic
        wateringüí¶, solar‚òÄÔ∏è, and ventilationüí® systems.
        The device is powered either through an adapter or
        an internal battery. The water tank should be filled
        for the irrigation system to work. After providing the
        necessary information about the plant to the device
        and making adjustments through the control panel,
        the process begins. After a certain period of time
        the growth of the plant can be observed.</p>

        <p>After 46 days, the weather started to warm up and I took it out to the balcony. It continued to grow under the sun.</p>
